# GWR---alcohol-availability-and-violent-crime


## About this project

This repository contains the code for the project where I implemented a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to understand the spatial relationship between alcohol availability and violent crime across all LSOA neighbourhoods in England.


## What data did I use?

- Violent crime - <a href = "https://data.police.uk" > Police UK data download </a>.
- Alcohol availability - <a href = "https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/access-healthy-assets-hazards-ahah">Access to Healthy Assets and Hazards Dataset</a>.
- Area level deprivation - <a href = "https://data-communities.opendata.arcgis.com/search?q=IMD&amp;sort=-modified" > Index of Multiple Deprivation data </a>.
- Population information - <a href = "https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland"> ONS mid-year estimates </a>.


## R Script

Note: some of the data was processed and cleaned outside of R, so the reader will not be able to copy + paste and run the code as it is seen. The purpose of the code is to guide reader into how the analysis was conducted. Instructions are provided to instruct the reader what to do where code is unavailable.
