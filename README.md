# GWR---alcohol-availability-and-violent-crime


## About this project

This repository contains the code for the project where I implemented a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to understand the spatial relationship between alcohol availability and violent crime across all LSOA neighbourhoods in England.


## What data did I use?

- Violent crime - <a href = "https://data.police.uk" > Police UK data download </a>.
- Alcohol availability - <a href = "https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/access-healthy-assets-hazards-ahah">Access to Healthy Assets and Hazards Dataset</a> and the <a href = "https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/removed-datasets" > CGA 2017 alcohol on trade outlet Index and volume Estimations dataset </a>.
- Area level deprivation - <a href = "https://data-communities.opendata.arcgis.com/search?q=IMD&amp;sort=-modified" > Index of Multiple Deprivation data </a>.
- Population information - <a href = "https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland"> ONS mid-year estimates </a>.
